# Search Bar (Interviewer Guide)

This question should be capped at 45 minutes. A Coderpad for this question should be set up and the link given to the candidate.

This question tests multiple frontend skillsets:

#### JavaScript
- asynchronous actions and Promises
- array iteration and understanding of JS standard library
- basic JS object manipulation
- browser APIs
  - event listeners
  - finding elements on the DOM

#### HTML
- semantic HTML
- forms

#### CSS
- CSS basics
- positioning and flexbox
- class nomenclature

### Other
- design intuition
- prioritization
- finding online documentation (everyone is going to have to look things up)

## How to give this question

Ask the candidate to think out loud.

Reassure the candidate that we are not looking for the most perfect code.

Something about time management -- should we tell the candidate that they have 45 min and to prioritize accordingly?

## How to evaluate

#### JavaScript
- Uses form submit handler to trigger `POST` action
- Knows ES6 syntax (e.g. `const`/`let`, arrow functions)
- Uses Array.prototype methods (`reduce`, `forEach`, `map`, etc.)
- Uses template strings instead of string concatenation

#### HTML
- Prefixes selectors used by JS with `js-`
- Ideal semantic HTML: a `<form>` element wrapping a `<select>` and `<button type="submit">`

#### CSS
- Reasonable class naming
- Knows shorthand (dimensions, border, etc.)

#### General
-
