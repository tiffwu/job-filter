# Search Bar (Interviewer Guide)

This question should be capped at 45 minutes. A Coderpad for this question should be set up and the link given to the candidate.

This question tests multiple frontend skillsets:

#### JavaScript
- asynchronous actions
- array iteration and understanding of JS standard library
- basic JS object manipulation
- browser APIs
  - event listeners
  - finding elements on the DOM

#### HTML
- semantic HTML
- forms

#### CSS
- basics
- class nomenclature

### Other
- reading comprehension
- attention to detail
- prioritization
- finding online documentation

## How to give this question

Tell the candidate to read the question in its entirety before getting started.

Ask the candidate to think out loud.

Reassure the candidate that we are not looking for the most perfect code.

Something about time management -- should we tell the candidate that they have 45 min and to prioritize accordingly?

If they struggle with CSS have them skip styling the select altogether.

#### Extra credit

If they finish early...

- Ask how they would clean up their code
- Ask for feedback on the question

## How to evaluate

#### JavaScript
- Uses form submit handler to trigger `POST` action
- Knows ES6 syntax (e.g. `const`/`let`, arrow functions)
- Takes advantage of JS language features such as array prototype methods
- Uses template strings instead of string concatenation
- Knows that innerHTML is an XSS risk unless properly escaped; uses createElement instead

#### HTML
- Ideal semantic HTML: a `<form>` element wrapping a `<select>` and a `<button type="submit">`

#### CSS
- Reasonable class names
- Knows shorthand (dimensions, border, etc.)

#### General
-
