# Search Bar (Interviewer Guide) [WIP]

This question should be capped at 45 minutes. A Coderpad for this question should be set up and the link given to the candidate.

This question tests multiple frontend skillsets:

#### JavaScript
- asynchronous actions
- array iteration
- familiarity with JS standard library
- browser APIs
  - event listeners
  - locating DOM elements

#### HTML
- semantic HTML
- forms

#### CSS
- basics
- class nomenclature

#### Other
- reading comprehension
- attention to detail
- prioritization
- online research

## How to give this question

Tell the candidate to read the question in its entirety before getting started.

Ask the candidate to think out loud as they complete the question.

Reassure the candidate that we are not looking for the most perfect code.

Something about time management -- should we tell the candidate that they have 45 min and to prioritize accordingly?

Or, we can timebox each section -- make sure the candidate has at least 20 minutes for the JS portion. HTML should take no longer than 10 minutes. 5 minutes of CSS should be sufficient to gauge experience.

#### Extra credit

If they finish early...

- Ask how they would clean up their code
- Have them update their code to handle infinite layers of role hierarchy
- Ask for feedback on the question

## How to evaluate

#### JavaScript
- Uses form submit handler to trigger `POST` action
- Knows ES6 syntax (e.g. `const`/`let`, arrow functions)
- Takes advantage of JS language features such as array prototype methods
- Uses template strings instead of string concatenation
- Knows that innerHTML is an XSS risk unless properly escaped; uses createElement instead

#### HTML
- Ideal semantic HTML: a `<form>` element wrapping a `<select>` and a `<button type="submit">`

#### CSS
- Reasonable class names
- Knows shorthand (dimensions, border, etc.)

#### General
-
